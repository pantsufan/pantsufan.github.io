      <description>&lt;p&gt;People overestimate the benefits of learning by consuming things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing and learning are two seperate things but both are very powerful tools with which can help you to build your audience and opens up a new world of opportunities to you to discover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the time we consume more and think that we are learning which is hoax. Whenever we stumble upon anything which we want to learn the first step is the absorb the material and then make notes about it. Think like you will be giving a lecture about the topic which you learnt. Making notes of your own will help you to deepen the understanding of the topic, a great example of this is feynman technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performing daily writing of what you learnt will create a reservoir of knowledge which you can then use for your success like sharing your learning with people online. This will also help you to improve your learning process because you will be getting feedback from the other people.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
