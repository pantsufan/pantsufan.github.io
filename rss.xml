      <title>Reduction of Page Size</title>
      <link>https://pantsufan.github.io/post/page-size/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Page Size Matters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days back, I came across the &lt;a href=&#34;https://512kb.club/&#34;&gt;512KB club&lt;/a&gt; that lists websites whose uncompressed page size is less than 512KB. I decided to give it a try. To my surprise, my page size was just under 400KB but, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t thrilled with the result. So I decided to cut down even more so, I set out on this adventurous journey of reducing my page size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.postimg.cc/hjgSs1KQ/prev-min.png&#34; alt=&#34;Previous page size&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got rid of unwanted JavaScript code and CSS that helped me reduce the page size by 40-50 KB. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t thrilled enough so, I got back again to debug what was causing the enormous page size. Luckily, I got my answer, and that was my favicon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A favicon is a small, iconic image that represents your website. My blog&amp;rsquo;s favicon was taking around 300 KB, due to which every time I requested my blog, the favicon was adding its extra size to the final page size. Upon discovering this issue, I redid my favicon as 32x32 instead of the previous 256x256.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicated fix massively improved the page size. Now, my blog&amp;rsquo;s uncompressed page size is 22.8 KB compared to the original 335.6 KB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.postimg.cc/3J7DYCKL/new-Result-min.png&#34; alt=&#34;Current page size&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the solution to our problem is right in front of us but, we don&amp;rsquo;t attempt to look at it thereby, wasting time and energy on something different.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Gaming Laptop Are Becoming Boring</title>
      <link>https://pantsufan.github.io/post/gaming-laptop/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fast but aliented&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, gaming is a medium to enjoy and not yell at friends like most of my friends do. I got myself a gaming laptop as a birthday gift. For the first few weeks, I played some of my favorite games and enjoyed every second of them. But I missed something that made me appreciate it even more and, that was playing it on low-end hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me get this point clear. All the systems which I owned till now were less than $300 in cost. Which also introduced me to the world of Linux since they were performing poorly on Windows. When I shifted to a $1000 laptop, I could feel the difference in performance, but that was all it for me. I could render my videos faster, play modern gaming titles &amp;amp; compile code quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when it came to gaming, I missed reading and watching tutorials online to get that last bit of FPS from the game on my older hardware. That was pure enjoyment for me since I could notice the difference it was making to the game after applying the tweaks. Some might not agree with me for the above point of view but, I feel that we have reached a stage where the law of diminishing returns makes more sense than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I mean by that is we don&amp;rsquo;t need expensive hardware to improve the workflow. Our experience will guide us to be better and more efficient at work by utilizing the systems which we own currently. For example, if I am rendering a video and it takes around 30 minutes to do so. I could spend that 30 minutes reading a chapter of the book that I picked up while my video is getting rendered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of 2021, I have stopped playing games and, I don&amp;rsquo;t see myself playing them in the future. I have been focusing on my web development skills lately and, I could see the difference it has brought to me. I have more time at hand than before and, I could complete my daily tasks with ease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Trying Out Spectrwm</title>
      <link>https://pantsufan.github.io/post/spectrwm/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Minimal window manager&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my previous post about awesome wm, &lt;a href=&#34;https://fosstodon.org/@joeligj12&#34;&gt;Chrono&lt;/a&gt; suggested trying out Spectrwm. Spectrwm is a small, dynamic tiling and reparenting window manager for X11. It was for the very first time I heard about this window manager so I decided to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went with ArcoLinuxB since it has the spectrwm version available to download. The installation went fast since I didn&amp;rsquo;t install any extra packages that ArcoLinux provides during installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now coming to Spectrwm, ArcoLinux has already configured most of the stuff so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to waste much time setting it up by myself. The keybindings are quite hard to find for a new user but since I knew where to lookup for the config I had no issues with that part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must say the window manager is quite minimal and easy to use if you remember properly the keybindings. ArcoLinux also comes with a few extra tricks at its sleeves. Such as preconfigured keybindings for most of the popular software, a key bind to change the wallpaper, and also a preconfigured polybar which is neat. It also has its own tweaks menu where you can set hblock, change the terminal theme, configure auto startup, and much more which is handy for a new user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall spectrwm can be the very first window manager for most of the new users and especially if you go with ArcoLinux since most of the stuff is already preconfigured and ready to use out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Trying Out Awesome WM</title>
      <link>https://pantsufan.github.io/post/awesome-wm/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A fast &amp;amp; easy window manager&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always wanted to get started with window managers, but the learning curve kept me away. So on 1st February 2021, I decided to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to mess up the primary system, I went with the virtual machine route. For the distro, I went with &lt;a href=&#34;https://manjaro.org/download/#awesome&#34;&gt;Manjaro&amp;rsquo;s community build of awesome&lt;/a&gt; after watching DistroTube&amp;rsquo;s video.

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qKtit_B7Keo&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setup process was similar to that of any Manjaro installation. It took around 8-10 minutes to install, and after installation finished, the first problem I encountered was how to change the wallpaper. The easy solution was to install Nitrogen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://s2.gifyu.com/images/2021-02-01-174146_2560x1080_scrot.png&#34; alt=&#34;manjaro after install&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, it took me more than 2 hours to configure the setup, according to my daily usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://s2.gifyu.com/images/2021-02-01-174128_2560x1080_scrot.png&#34; alt=&#34;my setup&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of applications that I use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;URXVT (Terminal)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ranger with W3M (Filemanager)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firefox (Web Browser)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rofi (Popup Window Switcher)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mousepad (GUI Text Editor)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out this video for more customization and setup.

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nC_e8Gw1XlA&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted with my current setup, nothing too fancy or too minimal. Get&amp;rsquo;s the job done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>YouTube-DL</title>
      <link>https://pantsufan.github.io/post/youtube-dl/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 02 Feb 2021 06:00:52 +0530</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Watch Content Offline&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past few weeks, I am off from YouTube. My YouTube channel is getting mirrored on &lt;a href=&#34;https://odysee.com/&#34;&gt;Odysee&lt;/a&gt;. But I still follow my favorite content creators using Invidious, Odysee, and youtube-dl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As most of you would know, what happened with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/github-reinstates-youtube-dl-after-riaas-abuse-dmca&#34;&gt;repository of youtube-dl&lt;/a&gt; I am glad that it&amp;rsquo;s back and functional again. Setting up youtube-dl for the first time can be troublesome for new users, but once you get the hang of it, you would not stop, especially with config, the download process becomes easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my config, and yes, I am on a Windows machine for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;-f mp4
-f 137+140/299+140
-o C:/Users/Joel/Downloads/YouTube/%(title)s-%(uploader)s.%(ext)s
--no-mtime
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refer &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/master/README.md#output-template&#34;&gt;Output Template&lt;/a&gt; for more details&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who wanted to get started with youtube-dl, here is a great video to begin.

&lt;iframe
  src=&#34;//invidious.kavin.rocks/embed/5axVgHHDBvU&#34;
  title=&#34;invidious player&#34;
  height=&#34;400&#34;
  frameborder=&#34;0&#34;
  marginwidth=&#34;0&#34;
  marginheight=&#34;0&#34;
  scrolling=&#34;no&#34;
  style=&#34;width: 100%&#34;
  allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34;
&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My process of getting videos offline is simple. Get the link of the video from invidious and paste it into the command prompt. But if I am on my phone, I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe&#34;&gt;Newpipe&lt;/a&gt; to watch and download YouTube videos.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Create More, Consume Less</title>
      <link>https://pantsufan.github.io/post/create/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;People overestimate the benefits of learning by consuming things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing and learning are two seperate things but both are very powerful tools with which can help you to build your audience and opens up a new world of opportunities to you to discover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the time we consume more and think that we are learning which is hoax. Whenever we stumble upon anything which we want to learn the first step is the absorb the material and then make notes about it. Think like you will be giving a lecture about the topic which you learnt. Making notes of your own will help you to deepen the understanding of the topic, a great example of this is feynman technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performing daily writing of what you learnt will create a reservoir of knowledge which you can then use for your success like sharing your learning with people online. This will also help you to improve your learning process because you will be getting feedback from the other people.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Habits are Learned</title>
      <link>https://pantsufan.github.io/post/habits/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Jan 2021 12:29:16 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://pantsufan.github.io/post/habits/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Life is made up of automatic actions called habits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I hear the term habits the first thought which comes to y mind is 21 Days, since it is know that a habit takes around 21 days to be formed or broken. Over the course of time I have read serveral books and blog post about the same but there are some core principles to be implemented in life to form habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A habit is formed from the repeated actions and the results behind is the formation of the reward. Our mind thinks that whenever we perform certain task we wil get that particular reward. Instant gratification works similarly. This also involves release of dopamine in our system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;habits-are-developed-using&#34;&gt;Habits are developed using:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cue&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;gt; Identifies the reward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carving&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;gt; Triggers to get the reward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;gt; Working out towards the reward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reward&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;gt; Satisfaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Habits can be good or bad but it is upto us to decide which of our habits we want in our daily lives. To break a habit just get rid of the source. For example, for social media just hide the apps or uninstall them. The main idea is to cut the source which triggers our brain to perform that particular habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;rsquo;s important to choose our habits wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
