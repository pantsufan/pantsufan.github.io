      <title>Create More, Consume Less</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;People overestimate the benefits of learning by consuming things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing and learning are two seperate things but both are very powerful tools with which can help you to build your audience and opens up a new world of opportunities to you to discover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the time we consume more and think that we are learning which is hoax. Whenever we stumble upon anything which we want to learn the first step is the absorb the material and then make notes about it. Think like you will be giving a lecture about the topic which you learnt. Making notes of your own will help you to deepen the understanding of the topic, a great example of this is feynman technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performing daily writing of what you learnt will create a reservoir of knowledge which you can then use for your success like sharing your learning with people online. This will also help you to improve your learning process because you will be getting feedback from the other people.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Habits are Learned</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Life is made up of automatic actions called habits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I hear the term habits the first thought which comes to y mind is 21 Days, since it is know that a habit takes around 21 days to be formed or broken. Over the course of time I have read serveral books and blog post about the same but there are some core principles to be implemented in life to form habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A habit is formed from the repeated actions and the results behind is the formation of the reward. Our mind thinks that whenever we perform certain task we wil get that particular reward. Instant gratification works similarly. This also involves release of dopamine in our system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;habits-are-developed-using&#34;&gt;Habits are developed using:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cue&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;gt; Identifies the reward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carving&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;gt; Triggers to get the reward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;gt; Working out towards the reward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reward&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;gt; Satisfaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Habits can be good or bad but it is upto us to decide which of our habits we want in our daily lives. To break a habit just get rid of the source. For example, for social media just hide the apps or uninstall them. The main idea is to cut the source which triggers our brain to perform that particular habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;rsquo;s important to choose our habits wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
